# Overview
Siing is a Nintendo Wii game that allows you to have fun with peripherals such as rock band's guitar, drums, and logitech usb Microphone. Siing is deployed using the Homebrew Browser or directly by saving the WAD file in an SD card and loaded with Wii Flow or any other loader.

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS:
   powerpc-eabi-gcc --version
   
   # Windows (in Command Prompt or PowerShell):
   powerpc-eabi-gcc --version
   ```

4. Install additional tools:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS:
   # WAD packaging tools
   sudo dkp-pacman -S wii-tools
   
   # Debugging tools
   sudo dkp-pacman -S wii-debug

   # Windows:
   # The Windows installer includes all necessary tools:
   # - wii-tools (WAD packaging tools)
   # - wii-debug (Debugging tools)
   # - Additional tools are located in C:\devkitPro\tools\bin
   ```
